Heat oven to 450.
Sauté the mushroom slices in the butter and season with salt and pepper.
Heat the breast in the microwave until warm.
Cut the baguette so that with the top off it looks like a “v” but

Live Lobsters
Store lobsters in the refrigerator until you are ready to use.
Before cooking I usually put them in cold water to clean them or you can rinse them.
Put some water in a pot with some vinegar.
When the water comes to a boil, put the lobsters in on a steamer basket.
It takes about 5 minutes per lobster, or cook until they are pinkish and no longer moving.

Lobster Tails
Make sure that if the tails were frozen that they are thawed out--otherwise they are hard to cut and very cold!
To cut, I cut them from the top down to the tail.
Then, I use a spoon and pull the meat away from the inside of the shell.
I place the meat on top of the shell, put on broiler pan.
Heat oven to 425.
Brush the tail with melted butter, sprinkle with Old Bay seasoning.
Bake for 15 minutes, then broil for 6-8 minutes until the meat or shell turns light brown.
Remove from oven, serve with melted butter.
If you don’t have Old Bay you can mix 1/4 t. salt, paprika with dash of pepper, cayenne pepper and allspice.
Remember when you use the broiler, to have the oven door open a little.
