Thickening:
mix 1 c. cornstarch, 1 T. sugar, water, soy
sauce.
Mix to get smooth, then add more soy sauce if needed
so that the color is slightly darker than a lunch bag.
Slowly add to stock and stir, I usually
add 1/2 - 3/4 of entire thickening.
Stir, and boil a few minutes, add more thickening if necessary.
Turn off and let season or add chicken and stir, serve.
I usually let it season for a while then reheat and add chicken and serve.

Alton Brown’s Fried Fish
Batter:

1 t. kosher salt
1/4 t. cayenne pepper
dash Old Bay Seasoning
1 bottle brown beer, cold
cornstarch for dredging
1 1/2 lb. firm whitefish could be tilapia, pollock, cod, cut into 1 oz. strips
In a bowl whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne pepper and Old Bay seasoning.
Whisk in the beer until the batter is completely smooth and free of any lumps.
Refrigerate for 15 minutes.
The batter can be made up to 1 hour ahead of time.
Heat oil to 350.
Lightly dredge fish strips in cornstarch.
Working in small batches, dip the fish into batter and immerse into hot oil.
When the batter is set, turn the
pieces of fish over and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
Drain the fish on a roasting rack.

Shrimp and Pesto Calzones
1 10 oz. pkg. refrigerated pizza dough
3 T. pesto
6 oz. frozen, thawed small shrimp
3 thin tomato slices
3 oz. mozzarella cheese
1 beaten egg white
Divide pizza dough into 3 pieces.
On a floured surface roll each piece of dough into a 6” circle. Spread 1 T. of the pesto atop half of each circle to within 1” of edges.
Top the pesto with 1/3 of the shrimp, 1 tomato slice, and 1/3 of the cheese leaving the other half of each circle and the edges uncovered.
Moisten edges of dough on each circle with egg white.
Fold each in half; seal edges with the tines of a fork to prevent filling from oozing out while baking.
Prick tops once or twice; brush with remaining egg white.
Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes.

Live Lobsters
Store lobsters in the refrigerator until you are ready to use.
Before cooking I usually put them in cold water to clean them or you can rinse them.
Put some water in a pot with some vinegar.
When the water comes to a boil, put the lobsters in on a steamer basket.
It takes about 5 minutes per lobster, or cook until they are pinkish and no longer moving.

Lobster Tails
Make sure that if the tails were frozen that they are thawed out--otherwise they are hard to cut and very cold!
To cut, I cut them from the top down to the tail.
Then, I use a spoon and pull the meat away from the inside of the shell.
I place the meat on top of the shell, put on broiler pan.
Heat oven to 425.
Brush the tail with melted butter, sprinkle with Old Bay seasoning.
Bake for 15 minutes, then broil for 6-8 minutes until the meat or shell turns light brown.
Remove from oven, serve with melted butter.
If you don’t have Old Bay you can mix 1/4 t. salt, paprika with dash of pepper, cayenne pepper and allspice.
Remember when you use the broiler, to have the oven door open a little.

Marinade for fish
I sometimes marinade fish or shrimp in zesty Italian dressing for several hours and then grill or bake the fish however you want.

Grandma's Tartar Sauce for Fish
mayo
garlic powder
relish
milk
Mix mayo (about 1 c.) with some milk (about 1-2 T.), add garlic powder to taste (1-2 t.) and relish (about 1/4 c.). Refrigerate until ready to serve.
I make this in advance and let the flavors marry.

2 T. parsley
1 1/2 t. basil
